# TwitchPlays - Interactive Chat-Controlled Gaming and Live Bots

TwitchPlays is a project that allows you to create interactive experiences for your Twitch or YouTube live streams. With this codebase, you can empower your viewers to control your keyboard and mouse, effectively enabling them to play games alongside you or interact with custom bots during your live broadcasts.

## Features

- **Chat-Controlled Interaction:** TwitchPlays lets your viewers control your keyboard and mouse inputs through chat messages, enabling collaborative gameplay experiences.
- **Customizable for Your Content:** You are encouraged to modify and adapt the provided Python code to suit your specific needs and creative ideas.
- **Multi-Platform Support:** The code is designed to work with both Twitch and YouTube live chats, providing flexibility for your streaming platform.
- **Educational and Open:** This project is built upon a foundation established by Wituz's Twitch Plays template, and it has been expanded by contributors like DougDoug, DDarknut, and Ottomated for YouTube integration. The code is uploaded for educational purposes, allowing you to learn and build upon it.

## Getting Started
